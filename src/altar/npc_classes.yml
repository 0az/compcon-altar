id: generic_tank
name: Generic Tank
role: artillery
info:
  flavor: >-
    A generic tank, complete with treads. Even in the Sixth Millennium, nothing beats a Tank for relatively cheap armored support.

    This applies only to infantry, of course. Against mechs, a conventional tank's armor may as well be paper-mâché.
  tactics: >-
    A tank is cheaper than any mech, including the Everest, and as such, does not have the same durability. Against Lancers, Tanks take on the role of "quantity" over "quality", firing en masse against agile targets, at range.

id: generic_ifv
name: Generic IFV
role: support
info:
  flavor: >-
    A generic infantry fighting vehicle. These staples of mechanized warfare have persisted for much longer than the Union itself, giving the squishy grunts inside a little more protections – at least until they jump out.
  tactics: >-
    IFVs have zero armor, at least at mech scale. Their weapons likewise are ineffective at all but the shortest ranges – and even then, don't do much. As such, against Mechs, IFVs remain in a clear supporting role. After all, even mechs are affected by smart-smoke.
base_features:
  - generic_autocannon_medium
  - npcf_crew_vehicle
  - npcf_transport_vehicle
  - npcf_limited_melee_vehicle
  - npcf_no_manipulators_vehicle
  - generic_no_tech_attacks

id: generic_truck
name: Generic Truck
role: support
info:
  flavor: >-
    A generic truck. Behind the frontlines, you'll see trucks moving troops and supplies alike. If one's in combat, something's gone terribly wrong – for the truck, at least.
  tactics: >-
    Against mechs, trucks are target practice. All but the lightest of mech weapons will render one into scrap. Furthermore, they usually carry no weapons or systems useful at a mech scale.
base_features:
  - generic_autocannon_medium
  - npcf_crew_vehicle
  - npcf_transport_vehicle
  - npcf_limited_melee_vehicle
